- restarted gui/ctrl implementation for sets with new concept
	- all node-based now after all.
	- sources are single nodes
	- filters are (multiple) sets of nodes of different sub-types ("starts with", "contains", "matches", "regex", etc.)
	- targets are always in a (semi-)fixed set. I'll reserve the option to implement functionality of mirroring data to an additional target and/or to remove a target permanently. All targets will still all be grouped into one logical unit (to visualize semi-static behaviour and since it'd probably less common to "frequently" alter the set of targets).
- superclassed BSNode, BSNodeItem to derive menu as well as all nodes (sources, filters, targets...) from it

- [in progress] previous Q/A: document code
- ViewSetsDetailsSources/Filters/Targets superclassed into ViewSetsDetailsContainer
- ViewSetsDetailsArrow superclassed into same class name (and subclassed separate arrows)
- ViewSets:
	- arrows have arrowheads now
	- added targets
	- added arrows between filters and targets
	- added uniform, default width for sources, filters, targets and expansion to relaxed width on hover

2013-05-20
- [done] clean-up old, obsolete code (commented out etc.)
- [done] refactor (session) controllers to follow a paradigm where "add" and "remove" perform associative changes, while "create" and "delete" do integral changes (to model/database)
- [done] ability to remove a source
	- session: Added BackupSetCtrl.remove_backup_source()
- implemented scroll area into view_sets_details
- set-up the whole view_sets dynamic custom layout management
- implemented a view_set_details_arrows arrow set (sources to filters for now)

2013-05-19
- isinstance(): converted all comparison class-paths to absolute paths (bs.session.~ vs. ~)
- restructured source-files: created bs.ctrl, ~.model and sorted files accordingly
- [done] fixed/expanded keyboard/mouse controls on ViewSetsSetsList
- ViewSetsSetsList gains focus on set_view
